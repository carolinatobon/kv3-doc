Creation of Series
===================

Metadata XML for series
------------------------

With the batch metadata schema,
we can load the following types of Kappa Objects (the catalogue type is
given by the root element of the XML).

* Working papers series
* Journals
* Periodicals
* Book Series

The schema is composed of a common group of metadata applicable to all types of series, plus specific metadata appicable to only one type of series.



Excel to XML for series (Old process)
