The creation form
==================

Create a new pyramid (work, expression and manifestation)
---------------------------------------------------------

You can use the form to enter manually the metadata of several bibliographic objects.
Just select the ``tab create > using form`` from the top menu

 Then select the tab corresponding to the object that you are trying to create.
 
 Currently you can create the following items :
 
 * Dataset
 * Dataset Group
 * Database
 * Book Series
 * Journal
 * Book Periodical
 * Working Papers Series

 Once you have selected the tab, the form fot metadata at work level will appear.
 
 If you need to revise what a work is please refer to :doc:`KappaNutshellModel`
 
 In this example we have selected to create a journal:

 **What you need to know** 
 
 * Mandatory fields are marked with an asterisk
 * When creating an IGO publication, please select ``NA`` as a directorate
 * Some fields are connected to Kappa taxonomies, you will be able to select a value from a list (themes, countries, imprints etc)
 * The loading of author names can be a little slow, please give it some time to load
 * You will not be able to change the authors affiliation in this form, to do so, create your object and edit the detailed page (see :doc:`DetailedPage`)
 
 Once you are done with the work metadata, you can advance to the next step : language versions
 
 Click on Language specific metadata

 **What you need to know** 
 
 * For the moment you cannot create a work only
 * Please create all the necessary manifestations because at the moment you will not be able to create them at a later stage
 * You can create several expressions at once, just click on ``Add new language``
 * The form filters the languages in the drop dow list based on those already selected in other expressions
 * At the moment it is not possible to create a multilingual expression from the interface

 The application will confirm the creation of all the new objects

 In this example a dataset edition  pyramid (Work, expression and manifestation) corresponding to three entries have been created successfully
 
 
**Congratulations !**  you have created a bibliographic record. To make sure it can be exported (or not depending on what you wish) please click on the manifestation link 
and edit the necessary metadata in the :doc:`DetailedPage` .

You might want to :

* update availability status
* if you have created a serial, update the ISSN
* add any other information relative to the format
* load a file
 
 In the detailed page : manifestation level, click on ``Actions`` then ``Edit``
 
 .. image:: images/CreationManifestation.JPG
 
 you have now access to all the metadata you need to edit at manifestation level

Add an expression to an existing work
---------------------------------------
 
 
 If you wish to add a language version to an existing publication, which means you are adding an expression to an existing work, you need to go to the detailed page
 (see :doc:`DetailedWork`. )
 
 
 
Add a manifestation to an existing expression
-----------------------------------------------
 
 
 .. warning:: This is not feasible yet from the interface form
 
 
 your case might be solved using other processes to creat the record, as :doc:`CreateUsingFiles`
