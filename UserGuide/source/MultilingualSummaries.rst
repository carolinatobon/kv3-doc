Multilingual summaries
=======================

OECD Publishing provides freely-available translations of the Executive Summaries of many key publications.  Most of the time the textual content of a MLS text is the same as the executive summary within the publication, but in some it may be different if the Editorial team judges useful to change the publication initial text. These summaries provide a synopsis of the contents and main findings from the full publication. 
They can be translated into over 20 languages. 
Available on the OECD iLibrary and main website at the publication date into PDF format, HTML and ePUB 

The following functions are available for multilingual summaries

Create new summaries
-----------------------

* You can generate multiple summaries in one batch

* The xml of a multilingual summary contains the metadata of the parent book (used to generate the work title) so you can start creating from any language (or all the languages at the same time). 

* Work level metadata as theme, webtopic, directorate are inherited from the parent book

* When a Multilingual summary is reloaded, the former one is overwritten BUT DOI and DOI title are preserved.
