OECD Observer Articles
========================


As from 2016, Observer articles are published online (in PDF and HTML format) in iLibrary as well as in other channels, 
independently of print issues.
A new publishing process is put in place, involving different systems and Kappa is one of them.


Observer articles publishing process

Search and filter
--------------------

To easily search for Observer articles in Kappa, use the facets ``Work`` and ``Catalogue types`` on the homepage:


Filter by 

Work type = **Paper**

Or by 
Catalogue type = **Article**

Create metadata record
---------------------------

The creation of an article's metadata record in Kappa is made **automatically** once the editors launch the export of 
the article from the Editorial System.


At this stage, Kappa creates the Work and the Expression (based on the article's language) metadata records of the article.

.. note:: Creation rule into Kappa: the article in EN must always be created first in Kappa.  

The translated article FR, when exported from Editorial System, is attached to the sameWork than the article EN, and the 
Expression FR is created.
