Objects available for consultation only
========================================

Kappa will replace the current publications database when all the published objects will be migrated and fully managed 
(creation, update, search, export) in the new base.

A periodic migration of the some KappaV2 objects is done every night. This allows us to visualize these objects in the new base, 
and to makie links among publications in the two databases.
It is not possible to update them and they are available only for consultation.

Currently you can see the following KappaV2 objects in Kappa:

* Books
* Periodicals
* Collections
* Articles
* Chapters
* Thematic groupings (Thematic keytable collections)
* Working Papers

We still have not migrated :

* Tables and Graphs
* Sections
* Key tables and Key Table Editions
* ILibrary packages
