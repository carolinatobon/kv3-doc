Kappa XML vs Content XML
========================

As you know, Kappa is an XML database. The pyramid model objects are stored in XML.


Kappa XML
------------

The internal format of the database is what we call the kappa XML.

You can vizualise the Kappa XML in two different ways, either showing the whole pyramid or only a slice at a certain level
(Work, Expression or Manifestation)

To retrieve the Kappa XML with the whole pyramid, just click on the ``Actions`` menu at work level :

At each level you will be able to retrieve the Kappa XML of that level via the ``Actions`` menu at the corresponding level :

Content XML

A second XML stored in the database and it is called the content XML.

The content XML can follow the rules of different schemas following the creation rules.

The content XML is visible at expression level when it is available.

Just click on ``view XML``
