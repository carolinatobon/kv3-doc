The records are :

* Filtered at Expression level (different language versions of a publication regardless of their format). 
* Sorted by publication date (latest first)


The facets allow the user to filter the records with different criteria. The number of records corresponding to the criteria selected is shown.
For exemple it is possible to select a year and the number of expressions published each year appears next to the facet

**NOTE** : only applicable metadata appear. If you select ``IGO=UN`` you will not find ``Indicator`` as an available catalogue type because there are no indicators with the metadata ``IGO=UN``

You will find an interesting new facet which calculates eligibility criteria (as of day-1 export, not the live update)
