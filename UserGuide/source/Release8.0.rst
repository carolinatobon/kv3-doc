Release 8.0 - March 23rd 2016
========================================

You will find the following new features :

Reports
--------

This is a very first version of reports generated from Kappa. 

The following two reports are available :

*	List of UN books: http://vs-pac-xml-4.main.oecd.org:10001/v1/report/report-un-book.xls 
*	List of UN serials with number of issues:  http://vs-pac-xml-4.main.oecd.org:10001/v1/report/report-un-serial.xls 

For the moment it is only possible to obtain them from the links, but they will soon be added to the interface to make them more easily accessible 


XML metadata loading for IGOs
------------------------------

*	It is now possible to load one publication without its chapters and add the chapters/sections at a later stage
*	The IGO team will be able to delete a work which has never been exported before (this will also delete all chapters and sections)


Creation of Records via the interface
--------------------------------------

Via the Create-Using form menu, it is now possible to create Databases, Book Series, Journals and Periodicals as well as the existing forms for Datasets and Dataset Groups.
It is today possible to create records for OECD and other IGOs (but please keep in mind that OECD series, journals and periodicals are still managed in Kappa V2).

Edition of records in the interface
-------------------------------------

*  UN Periodicals and Collections metadata are now editable via the interface (at all three levels, work, expression and manifestation)
 


You will also notice some changes in the User interface ergonomy and available facets for filtering Kappa records.

Should you need any further explanation or if you wish to have a demo, please do not hesitate to contact KappaPOTeam@oecd.org

Thank you very much to all the people involved in all this work !
